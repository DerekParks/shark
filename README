This is a quick hacked combo of three different projects. It includes a command line radio shark control app, a python schedule parser, and a podcast feed generator.
  
More info about the command line client can be found here: http://javier.rodriguez.org.mx/index.php/2006/06/10/griffin-radio-shark-icecast2-on-debian-gnulinux

I only updated the Makefile to compile on Ubuntu 14.04. The orginal README states a Public Domain licence.

The python schedule parser contains some of my small changes to the orginal repo that can be found here: https://github.com/KenKundert/radioshark/ No license is stated.
